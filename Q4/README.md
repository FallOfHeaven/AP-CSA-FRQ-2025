## Question 4 Analysis

### Clearing Pair and Going Through a 2D Array

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (Making a 2D Array):

#### Approach during the exam:

1. Think what was needed base on the description provided.
2. Make sure if the question returns something you put keyword return with the correct data type.
3. Write down pieces of solutoion(s) base on those thoughts.
   - For example: in this question it talked about helper method like **clearPair()** and constructor **SumOrSameGame()** so you should:
      - Write down "//clearPair()" and "//SumOrSameGame()"(with what is needed in the parameter) so you won't forget.
      - Write down "//if this ... happens, ... will happen" so you remember ideas that you have.
4. Code the ideas you have above.
5. Since you can copy and paste your codes, if you don't think the code will work then copy a verison of your code, paste it and edit it to compare the code which you think will work.
6. If you think it works, don't do extra things, it might let you overthink things.
   

#### My revised solution after review:

- Nothing really, I think it was a striaght forward question as they give you an example of what will happen if this happens.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:

- How to create methods.
- How to create constructor.
- How to declare and intialize a 2D array.
- How to make it so that you can traverse through the a 2D array.
- How to set condition so that the loop will continue while skipping certain element in the array.
- Reading comprehension based on the example and explanation given.

#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

- Nothing really, I think it was a striaght forward question.
