# AP-CSA-FRQ-2025
These are all my answer to the 2025 AP CSA FRQ.
If there is anything wrong, you can tell me.
## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 5/7/2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included reading, praticing at home, going to tutoring even if you don't need help and think of problem that might occur when programming certain codes.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were to think potential soultion and which solution fit to question being asked.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me is when you scan a problem and you think it is to diffcult for you, skip it and move on, come back later.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions to be clam, sleep well before the day of the exam and don't stress too much when you encounter something you don't know.

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: Problem Thinking (What problem might occur)
- Topic/Concept 2: Condition for something to do something

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html
- Youtube
- Internet
- Teacher
- Peer

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Learn more about coding languages and how to efficently use them to solve problems.
- Create a game that everyone can enjoy and have fun.
- Read more and pratice what problem might occur when you are doing something.
