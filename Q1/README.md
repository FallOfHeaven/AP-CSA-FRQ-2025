## Question 1 Analysis

### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### Approach during the exam:

1. Think what was needed base on the description provided.
2. Make sure if the question returns something you put keyword return with the correct data type.
3. Write down pieces of solutoion(s) base on those thoughts.
   - For example: in this question it talked about helper method like **numAvailableDogs()** and **updateDogs()** so you should:
      - Write down "//numAvailableDogs()" and "//updateDogs()" so you won't forget.
      - Write down "//if this ... happens, ... will happen" so you remember ideas that you have.
4. Code the ideas you have above.
5. Since you can copy and paste your codes, if you don't think the code will work then copy a verison of your code, paste it and edit it to compare the code which you think will work.
6. If you think it works, don't do extra things.
